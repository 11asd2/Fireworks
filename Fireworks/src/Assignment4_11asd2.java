 * Description:
 * A Roman Candle Fireworks Simulation implementing bonus features such as allowing the wind speed and tube angle to change
 * during the middle of an animation via the use of JSliders. The Assignment 3 solution was used as a starting point, on top of which I built the GUI class and this class.
 * Some minor additions were made to the sample code in the ParticleManager, Emitter, and Environment classes. I have
 * made comments such as "addition by me", where ever I added the new code in the above three classes.
